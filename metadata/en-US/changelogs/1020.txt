10.2:

This update introduces a fix for a bug that occurred on some devices so they could not use CyclosApp due to GPS not being found even if the device gets a good GPS signal.

If you think that this is still not fixed, please open an issue at the project repository or send me an email. Thanks.

10.1:

- Show stop points (pauses) on the fullscreen map

- Added icons for horseback riding and skiing
- Better performance when viewing long workouts
- Import multiple workouts moved to the main screen
- Import all tracks from a GPX-file

- Correctly import workout types from backups

please see the project repository on Codeberg for a more detailed list of changes
