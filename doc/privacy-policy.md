# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy sets out how the Android app "Cyclos App" uses and protects your personal data that you provide, or that is otherwise obtained or generated.

## Collected information

As the creator/maintainer of Cyclos App I, Gabriel Estrada, DO NOT COLLECT ANY PERSONAL DATA.

Cyclos saves all settings and workout related data on the device. This includes:

- settings
- GPS samples recorded during the workout
- aggregated workout data
- interval sets

## How the data is used

The data is used to record your workouts and display statistics after your workouts.

Please also view the [Permissions-Statement](https://codeberg.org/jannis/CyclosApp/wiki/Permissions) that explains why CyclosApp needs the permissions it requests.

## What data is shared

Private information are NEVER shared without your consent.

If you choose to upload your workouts as GPS-traces to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) in order to improve the map quality the workout route will be transferred to the OpenStreetMap Foundation so please refer to their [Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) to learn more about how the data is used.
Cyclos App gives the option to protect your routes so they are publicly not linked to your account by choosing the visibility option "private".
Further CyclosApp is able to cut the start and finish of your uploaded route to hide the location where you started (e.g. your home location).

## Usage of the map

The map displayed in CyclosApp is loaded from OpenStreetMap. Please refer to their [Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy) to learn more about how the data are used that you provide with your map requests such as your IP-address.
