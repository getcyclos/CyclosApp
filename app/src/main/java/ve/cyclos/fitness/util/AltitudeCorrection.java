/**
 * This class has the task to correct the altitude.
 * <p>
 * In Germany or UK for example the GPS height differs
 * roughly 50m from the real elevation over sea level.
 * <p>
 * The altitude given by GPS is the altitude over the WGS84 reference ellipsoid
 * but we want the height over the sea level. That's why we have to correct the height.
 * Luckily I found a file containing the corrections for all places around the world.
